## 🌟 Core Innovation: The Crystal Core

The centerpiece of this application is the **3D Interactive Crystal Core** - an octahedron-based navigation system that revolutionizes how stories are told in digital media:

- **6 Interactive Vertices**: Each vertex represents a story chapter with unique colors and themes
- **Real-time 3D Rendering**: Powered by WebGL and React Three Fiber
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Each chapter has its own color-coded lighting system
- **Smooth Animations**: Fluid transitions between chapters with orbital mechanics
- **Multiple Navigation Methods**: Click, drag, keyboard shortcuts, and direct vertex selection
